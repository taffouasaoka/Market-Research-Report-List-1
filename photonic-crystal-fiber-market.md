<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Photonic crystal Fiber Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Index-Guiding Fibers</li><li>Photonic Bandgap (Air Guiding) Fibers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The photonic crystal fiber market comprises two main types: index-guiding fibers and photonic bandgap (air-guiding) fibers. Index-guiding fibers manipulate light through a refractive index difference between the core and cladding, facilitating efficient signal transmission. In contrast, photonic bandgap fibers use periodic structures to create a photonic bandgap, effectively guiding light by reflecting it within the core, often with air or low-index materials. Both types offer unique advantages for telecommunications, sensors, and various high-tech applications.</p></p>
